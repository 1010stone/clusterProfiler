	abstract = {Increasing quantitative data generated from transcriptomics and proteomics require integrative strategies for analysis. Here, we present an R package, clusterProfiler that automates the process of biological-term classification and the enrichment analysis of gene clusters. The analysis module and visualization module were combined into a reusable workflow. Currently, clusterProfiler supports three species, including human, mouse and yeast. Methods provided in this package can be easily extended to other species and ontologies. The clusterProfiler package is released under Artistic-2.0 License within Bioconductor project.

	abstract = {Summary: The semantic comparisons of Gene Ontology (GO) annotations provide quantitative ways to compute similarities between genes and gene groups, and have became important basis for many bioinformatics analysis approaches. GOSemSim is an R package for semantic similarity computation among GO terms, sets of GO terms, gene products and gene clusters. Four information content (IC)- and a graph-based methods are implemented in the GOSemSim package, multiple species including human, rat, mouse, fly and yeast are also supported. The functions provided by the GOSemSim offer flexibility for applications, and can be easily integrated into high-throughput analysis pipelines.

	abstract = {Estrogen receptor {(ER)} expression and proliferative activity are established prognostic factors in breast cancer. In a search for additional prognostic motifs, we analyzed the gene expression patterns of 200 tumors of patients who were not treated by systemic therapy after surgery using a discovery approach. After performing hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified coregulated genes related to the biological process of proliferation, steroid hormone receptor expression, as well as B-cell and T-cell infiltration. We calculated metagenes as a surrogate for all genes contained within a particular cluster and visualized the relative expression in relation to time to metastasis with principal component analysis. Distinct patterns led to the hypothesis of a prognostic role of the immune system in tumors with high expression of proliferation-associated genes. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, the proliferation metagene showed a significant association with metastasis-free survival of the whole discovery cohort [hazard ratio {(HR)}, 2.20; 95\% confidence interval (95\% {CI)}, 1.40每3.46]. The B-cell metagene showed additional independent prognostic information in carcinomas with high proliferative activity {(HR}, 0.66; 95\% {CI}, 0.46每0.97). A prognostic influence of the B-cell metagene was independently confirmed by multivariate analysis in a first validation cohort enriched for high-grade tumors (n = 286; {HR}, 0.78; 95\% {CI}, 0.62每0.98) and a second validation cohort enriched for younger patients (n = 302; {HR}, 0.83; 95\% {CI}, 0.7每0.97). Thus, we could show in three cohorts of untreated, node-negative breast cancer patients that the humoral immune system plays a pivotal role in metastasis-free survival of carcinomas of the breast. {[Cancer} Res 2008;68(13):5405每13]},
